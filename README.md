# FoxSymulator
**About project:**
It's my a first dart project what I created. I don't have a big plan.
My plan is very simple:
1. Do a simple console game. 
2. Fix a few of bugs..
3. I going to chill and after this I doing more fix.

# About game:
It's a third game about Fox what I do. It's really funny, but I quite like foxes. In this game you can go hunting, sleaping, fighting, change locations. 

# Game progress:
I don't know :) but just it can stay 5%

# About me:
